                LinkedIn (/lɪŋktˈɪn/) is an American business and employment-oriented service that operates via websites and mobile apps. 
                Founded on December 28, 2002,[6] and launched on May 5, 2003,[7] it is mainly used for professional networking, including employers posting jobs and job seekers posting their CVs.

                LinkedIn allows members (both workers and employers) to create profiles and "connections" to each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. 
                Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection.[9] 
                LinkedIn participated in the EU's International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.[10]
